## How to get better - Leadership perspective

I value authentic and sincere relationships. I love being surrounded by competent people that love solving problems. I believe in empowering team members by giving them freedom to implement their ideas as long as they are accountable for their work.

## Expectations

I want to establish an open culture where it feels natural to talk about what's going on. I don't like a work atmosphere where people are complaning behind the backs of their co-workers and don't explicitly mention what they think is going wrong.
As for conflicts, they will inevitably occur and my opinion is that this is not always bad. If people are honest about the situation and are open to criticism, good things can come out of it
