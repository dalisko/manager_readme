# My manager readme - Konstantinos Ntalis

## How to get better - Leadership perspective

I value authentic and sincere relationships. I love being surrounded by competent people that love solving problems. I believe in empowering team members by giving them freedom to implement their ideas as long as they are accountable for their work.

## Expectations

I want to establish an open culture where it feels natural to talk about what's going on. I don't like a work atmosphere where people are complaning behind the backs of their co-workers and don't explicitly mention what they think is going wrong.
As for conflicts, they will inevitably occur and my opinion is that this is not always bad. If people are honest about the situation and are open to criticism, good things can come out of it.

## 1:1s & working hours

1:1s should be happening regularly and I want to keep track of the conversations with the people I manage in order to be able to refer back to it. There are no specific rules for these and engineers shouldn't feel that the manager should necessarily lead the meeting. It's mostly about figuring out expectations and understanding each other better.

I think remote working is important. You shouldn't have to explain to me why you need to work remotely, it's fine! As long as the work is done, we can find the right balance. However, keep in mind that I believe team interaction is very important and the only way to solve a problem sometimes.
